Sure! Here is the explanation of the program in Markdown format:

### Program Explanation

#### File Specification (F-Spec)
```rpg
fflatfile  if   e           k disk    RENAME(FLATFILE:RECORD)PREFIX('P_')
f                                     extmbr('MBR16011')
```
- `fflatfile`: Indicates the file name being defined.
- `if`: Specifies that the file is an input file.
- `e`: Specifies that the file has externally described data.
- `k`: Indicates that the file is keyed.
- `disk`: Specifies that the file is a disk file.
- `RENAME(FLATFILE:RECORD)`: Renames the record format name from `FLATFILE` to `RECORD`.
- `PREFIX('P_')`: Adds the prefix `P_` to all fields in the file.
- `extmbr('MBR16011')`: Specifies that the external member `MBR16011` is used.

#### Data Definition (D-Spec)
```rpg
DRESULT           S             25
```
- `RESULT`: A standalone field defined with a length of 25 characters.

#### Calculation Specification (C-Spec)
```rpg
C                   READ      RECORD
```
- `READ RECORD`: Reads a record from the `RECORD` file.

```rpg
C                   DOW       NOT %EOF()
```
- `DOW NOT %EOF()`: A Do-While loop that continues until the end of the file (`%EOF`).

```rpg
C                   EVAL      RESULT = %SUBST(P_FLATFILE:1:25)
```
- `EVAL RESULT = %SUBST(P_FLATFILE:1:25)`: Evaluates the `RESULT` field by extracting the first 25 characters from the `P_FLATFILE` field.

```rpg
C     RESULT        DSPLY
```
- `DSPLY RESULT`: Displays the value of the `RESULT` field.

```rpg
C                   READ      RECORD
```
- `READ RECORD`: Reads the next record from the `RECORD` file.

```rpg
C                   ENDDO
```
- `ENDDO`: Ends the Do-While loop.

```rpg
C                   EVAL      *INLR = '1'
```
- `EVAL *INLR = '1'`: Sets the last record indicator (`*INLR`) to '1', indicating the end of the program.

### Overall Flow
1. **File Handling**: The program reads from an externally described disk file named `FLATFILE`, using the record format `RECORD` and member `MBR16011`.
2. **Data Extraction**: It processes each record in the file by extracting the first 25 characters from the `P_FLATFILE` field, which is prefixed with `P_` due to the `PREFIX` keyword.
3. **Display Output**: The extracted data is stored in a variable named `RESULT` and is displayed to the user.
4. **Loop Control**: The program continues to read and process records until it reaches the end of the file (`%EOF`).
5. **End of Program**: Once all records are processed, the program sets the last record indicator (`*INLR`) to `1`, indicating that the program has completed its execution.

****************** End of data ******************************************
```

- Then create a flatfile using `ADDPFM` for specific member 
- Change maximum member size to `NOMAX`
- then run the above program.
