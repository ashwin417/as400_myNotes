## ERRORS AND SOLUTIONS

#### HOW TO CHECK ERRORS?
        IF PROGRAM DIDN'T COMPILE PROPERLY, OPEN `WRKSPLF` FILE. CHECKOUT THE ERROR CODE (OR PAGE UP) AND GO FOR HIGHEST SEVERITY ERROR AND TRY CORRECTING IT.

        IF ERROR AFTER COMPILATION, CHECK OUT THE LOGIC, IF THERE IS ERROR WITH 00 SEVERITY, CAN TRY CHECKING IN WRKSPLF ITSELF. ELSE GO FOR DEBUG OPTION.

`The name or indicator is not referenced.`
    
    CHECK OUT IF VARIABLES, RECORD NAME IS ALL CORRECT. 
    CHECK IF FILE NAME IS CORRECTLY DEFINED.

`Record-Format name of Externally-Described file is not used.`

    CHECK OUT RECORD NAMES USED IN OPCODE AND VERIFY IT WITH RECORDS IN PFs.

`Array has too many omitted indexes; specification is ignored.`

    ENSURE PROPER INDEXING AND USE OF DIM()

`SESSION ERROR ON THE RUN SCREEN`

    CHECK OUT RRN IS PROPERLY INTIALIZED AND USED IN THE PROGRAM

`SESSION GETTING STUCKED AFTER CALL BUT COMPILED SUCCESSFULLY`

    CHECK OUT READ OPCODE OR LOOPS IS USED CORRECTLY

`DECIMAL DATA ERROR IN RUNTIME SCREEN`

    CHECK OUT DECIMAL TYPE USED IN PF/SCREEN/REPORT/PROGRAM IS SAME AND CHECK OUT THE NEED OF ZONED/PACKED TYPE.
